# Matrix Completion Mini-Project

By: Aaron Berk

For the BC Data Science Workshop 2017

## Summary

A whirlwind introductory to matrix completion methods with several
exercises (some of which have never been done before, ever!)

## Important note

This notebooke requires the splitting cone solver `SCS` to be
installed. Normally this is automatically installed by `cvxpy`;
however, on the bcdata.syzygy.ca server, the blas/lapack libraries are
not linked to this solver. If you want to see how this code performs,
try running it on your own machine by `git clone`-ing the repository
to your own computer.
